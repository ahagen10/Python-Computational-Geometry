# Python-Computational-Geometry

Description: This project required students to utilize previous learnings to create code that resembles the fundamentals of CAD software. For simplicity, this project focused on computing in two dimensions; though, the same algorithms would be utilized for three dimensions. 

Goals: 
- Learn to define and use various functions in Python 
- Use calculus to create computational geometric algorithms
- Identify the outer boundary for set of points
- Triangulate the outer boundary for a set of points
- Compute distance a given point in space is located from boundary
